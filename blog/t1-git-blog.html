<h3>Week 1 of DBC illuminates Github</h3>

<p>Git can be compared to an old school digital rolodex where you store information. Only instead of storing info on your friends that information is code.  It lives in a finite place, say, on your computer and you can make additions to the rolodex if someone changed their name. </p>

<p>Github, not to be confused with Git, takes this to the next level. It would be like if your rolodex was instead live on the web, where you and friends could contribute. It is similar to how Google+ and Gmail work together to update your contacts -- both by your contributions and by your contacts themselves.
</p>

<p>What's more is that both and Github work together to produce the brilliance that is version control. Version control is solving for a problem that often happens when one works on content: losing changes. Github helps with this because it is a central platform where as many as hundreds of collaborators who are working together can manage the different versions of their project.
</p> 

<p>What does this look like in real time?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Usually this will involve a step like pushing to a branch (almost like sharing a draft with friends before sharing the final copy)</li>
	<li>Then you will do a pull request to ensure that someone ( a teammate or superior) can approve their changes before integrating them into the final document. </li> 
	<li>Then the last step is to merge the changes into the master branch (or final document)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool stuff, huh? Go and Git you some!</p>
